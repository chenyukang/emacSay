This is an Emacs Minor Mode: emacSay 
With this minor mode, Emacs can say the word which you have just input onto screen. 

NOTE: this minor mode is only available on Mac OS, because it will call the "say" command .

Usage: 
     1. put emacsay-mode.el at .emacs.d(or someother dir), 
        add (load-file "~/.emacs.d/emacsay-mode.el")
     2. run emacsay-mode (or bind any hotkey you like) 

     then type english word and funning thing happend :) 

Default hotkey:      
    (define-key map "\C-cs" 'say-current-string)  ;;say the word in cursor 
    (define-key map "\C-cp" 'say-buffer) ;;say all current buffer 
    (define-key map "\C-ct" 'say-stop)   ;;stop saying current buffer 

RoadMap:
    Add different type of voice.
